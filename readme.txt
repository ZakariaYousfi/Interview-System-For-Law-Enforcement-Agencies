This is my master's project. It is a web application which enables investigators to input interview data. the system provides  two AI technologies: contradiction detection and question recommendation. Our contradiction detection is a rule based method  where we structure the input to guarentee 100% precision by providing predefined questions to extact relations which are then  compared. We only did contradiction detection for person-person relation and person-location relation. As for the question  recommendation, we used the database as a means for extracting questions that are most relevant to the last question answer  pair that was inputted in the interview. the case type and person type are taken into consideration aswell. the code is pretty much a full fontend backend db application. for front we used vite since the application isn't too page heavy to justify using  nextJS, and for backend we used python because of the AI part. For other choices explanation see thesis for further information.
