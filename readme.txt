This is my master's project. It is a web application which enables investigators to input interview data. the system provides 
two AI technologies: contradiction detection and question recommendation. Our contradiction detection is a rule based method 
where we structure the input to guarentee 100% precision by providing predefined questions to extact relation which are then 
compared. We only did contradiction detection for person-person relation and person-location relation. As for the question 
recommendation, we used the database as a means for extracting questions that are most relevant to the last question answer 
pair that was inputted in the interview. the case type and person type are taking into consideration aswell. see thesis for further info.
